# Churn-analysis

This project aims to analyze customer churn data from a telecommunications company. By examining various factors such as demographics, service usage, and customer satisfaction, we seek to identify the primary drivers of customer attrition and develop strategies to improve retention.
The analysis will delve into key metrics like churn rate, customer demographics, service usage patterns, and customer feedback to uncover actionable insights.

## Recommendations :

•	Target High-Churn Segments: Focus on improving retention for male customers, younger age groups, and customers in Jammu.

•	Optimize Internet Services: Investigate why fiber optic customers have a higher churn rate and consider offering promotions or improvements to this service.

•	Review Payment Options: Explore alternative payment methods or incentives for customers using credit cards or bank transfers.

•	Offer Longer-Term Contracts: Consider providing discounts or benefits for customers who sign up for longer-term contracts.

•	Enhance Customer Experience: Address the top reasons for churn (competition, attitude, and dissatisfaction) by improving customer service, product quality, or pricing.

•	Analyze Churn by Service Bundle: Determine if specific combinations of services are more likely to lead to churn and adjust offerings accordingly.

•	Leverage Customer Feedback: Actively collect customer feedback to identify areas for improvement and address concerns promptly.

By conducting a more in-depth analysis and implementing targeted strategies, the company can significantly reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
